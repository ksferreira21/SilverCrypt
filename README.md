# SilverCrypt - Secure Password Manager

## üìå About

In today's digital age, managing multiple passwords has become a challenge, especially when dealing with long and complex passwords for different online accounts. I needed a secure way to store and manage these passwords without relying on third-party services that could compromise my privacy.

That's how I developed **SilverCrypt** ‚Äî a simple yet secure password manager that allows you to store, encrypt, and retrieve your passwords securely. Using a master password, SilverCrypt protects your sensitive data and gives you full control over your passwords.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîí **Secure Encryption**: All passwords are encrypted with strong algorithms and can only be decrypted with the master password.
- üíª **Simple Terminal Interface**: A clean and easy-to-use interface to manage your passwords.
- ‚òÅ **Google Drive Integration**: Option to securely store your encrypted passwords on Google Drive, allowing access from anywhere.
- üîç **Password Management**: Add, list, and retrieve your passwords securely.

## ‚ùì Why SilverCrypt?

I created **SilverCrypt** because managing passwords securely is more important than ever, and many existing password managers are cloud-based, which can pose a security risk. **SilverCrypt** was designed to give you full control over your data, ensuring everything remains private.
